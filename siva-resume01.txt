+++ Role +++
I have a blended skill set of Consulting, Product envisioning & Product Architecture.
I work with our customers for Requirements gathering and delivery. Building projects/product extensions based on customer needs. When situations arise develop proof of concepts and reusable components. Eventually, I work with the product management to roll up those additions into the Product base.
In these engagements, I own the customer interaction for Specification till delivery. Manage the professional services engineers to deliver. 

I have successfully applied my customer engagement & design experience to create 3 products for the company. Two in manufacturing and aerospace and another in Retail Operations.  I have owned Product management ( with the exception of marketing & pricing ) and Product architecture/design for these products.  I was also directing the engineering team which was developing these products.

My core strength lies in system designing, UX architecture and engineering of solutions/products. I have successfully applied these across distinct industries such as aircraft manufacturing, airlines, retail operations and hospitals. These different contexts also bring in a very wide spectrum of technologies which I quickly grasp with.
